Such salient questions! Turns out the kids aren't as informed as one would think...

Continued thanks to Zaukodar (Callie) and Ashley Nichols (Kira) for their Patreon cameos!


The CHAPTER 3 KICKSTARTER is on its way, ready to launch on a SECRET DAY in August!!! Packed full of fun goodies and a gorgeous printed book copy of Chapter 3, you won't want to miss it!

There are a limited amount of SKETCHED BOOKPLATE BOOKS available which will contain a personalized, hand-drawn sketch! Dying to get one? They're going to go fast!

The campaign will be launched first for $3+ Patrons, so they get FIRST SHOT at those sketch slots!
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/tamberlane">Support at $3+ and get your headstart!</a>

Not able to support the Patreon? That's fine too! After the $3+ patrons get 12 hours, the KICKSTARTER MAILING LIST gets the next shot! This is DIFFERENT from the normal mailing list.
 <a href="https://mailchi.mp/8e01128cc98e/tamberlaneks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for the mailing list HERE!</a>

After that, it'll go live to the public and I'll drop a post HERE! I'm super excited, you guys. It's going to be so GREAT!

To help this Kickstarter be the VERY BEST it can be! Share the comic with your friends and spread the word! Get everyone SUPER PUMPED!
