Some new cameos today! Firstly, the possum is Fallon Bard - Fallboard's character, from the "Your Character Here" auction winner! I'd say he looks pretty cute!

Next, in that first panel, the meerkat is Timmo, another peek at a Patreon cameo. (Like all of these patreon cameos, it won't just be limited to a tiny appearance on the horizon; of course he'll get some proper 'screen' time too!)

The bird isÂ <a href="http://www.greywhiteart.com/">Grey White</a>, and the bear is their husband Davin!

You can watch the making of this page on YouTube!
