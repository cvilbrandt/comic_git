        <h2>Tamberlane is a webcomic about a clumsy bat and her very human baby...</h2>
        <p>The animal citizens of Treehollow have discovered a small, strange creature wandering alone in the forest:
            a human child! Clearly much too young to be on her own, itâ€™s anyoneâ€™s guess how this mysterious being, named
            Tamberlane, ended up in their town of Treehollow.</p>
        <p>Fostered by Belfry, the accident-prone bat, and guided by a colorful cast of animal characters, Tamberlaneâ€™s
            mysteries continue to unfold. But questions burn in everyoneâ€™s minds: who, and <em>what,</em> is she? And could she
            have something to do with the far-off and unspeakable taboo, Abroad?</p>
        <p><h3>Updates every Wednesday.</h3></p>
        <p><em>Rated PG for occasional simplified, cartoonish, non-sexual nudity.</em></p>

                    and art are all so wonderful. I know a lot of hard work and time went into this, PLEASE KEEP IT UP!</p>

                <p class="review">I happened upon Tamberlane around two years ago and was in a very bad place in my life.
                    I just wanted a distraction from everything and wound up loving the comic so much it actually
                    brightened up my bleak outlook at the time. Itâ€™s so genuine and sincere about all the topics it
                    covers. 10/10 always read again!</p>

                <p class="review">Tamberlaneâ€™s story draws you into a world that in many ways resembles the fables of
                    antiquity, with a country village full of talking animals leading simple lives. Yet there is also a
                    mystery here, and Tamberlane herself is at the heart of it. What is she? Where does she come from,
                    and how did she get there? Caytlin brings a very familiar, emotionally resonant aspect to the tale,
                    making us feel all of Belfry the batâ€™s struggles in the unexpected, challenging role as a parent to
                    the unusual child. Sit down and give this story a look â€” you wonâ€™t be disappointed.</p>
