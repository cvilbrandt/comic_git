That darn cat!

You may notice that the website has been updated and changed! Surprise! :D I've been working for the last two months on this site. We've migrated off of Squarespace (and therefore fixed a lot of the really buggy things about the site) and onto Wordpress! For those of you supporting Tamberlane on Patreon, there's a Patron-only section with links to rewards, and the WIP blog has moved here too! Eventually, if I can get it to work, I'll have a section where patrons can check on the latest comic available for them, but for now, that's but a dream.

Still, for now, I think it looks smashing! I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do!

I'm sure there will be technical difficulties over the next few days; drop me a line via comments here or over email at artist@cvilbrandt.com! I'll fix it as fast as I'm able :)

<del><b>EDITED TO ADD:</b> Patreon login is currently having issues, which I am working on resolving. Thanks for your patience!</del>

<strong>EDIT 2:Â </strong>Patreon issues should be resolved! Let me know if there are any other problems and I'll fix them ASAP.
