More questions, and some more questions, and still more questions!

CrookedGlasses's Jentzen the cheetahwolf has finally been able to make a more substantial appearance. Yay! There's a bunch of text edits I wanted to make but honestly, it'll just have to happen for print. Cut me some slack, I am very tired

Anyway, thanks also as usual to Chaon for Cur and Zaukodar for Callie. Thanks for lending me your children!


BWOOP BWOOP! THIS IS NOT A DRILL! BWOOP BWOOP!

If you're looking for a beautiful printed copy of any of the three chapters so far, you're in the right place! Tamberlane's Chapter 3 Kickstarter is off with a BANG! The heart-squeezing comic about a disaster bat trying to care for a mysterious creature -- a human child -- has so many great prizes! And there are lots of chances for even MORE!
