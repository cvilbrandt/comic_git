Right to the kisser! Ouch!

Special thanks to patrons Chaon for Cur, Ashley Nichols for Kira, and Jonas for Jonas! Thanks for letting me use your babies!

An incredibly rare opportunity has surfaced! For the first time in several years, I am vending at a convention!

Come see me at table 904 at GeekGirlCon this weekend in Seattle! I'll have tons of great stuff for sale, including Chapter 3, tote bags, blankets, enamel pins, stickers, and more!

This isn't going to happen often: I'm unable to travel much and I have to safeguard my health. So if you want to meet me and say hi, maybe pick up some awesome merch, now's a good chance! I hope to see you all there!

Kickstarter fulfillment should go off without a hitch over the next three days in preparation, so if you're expecting a Kickstarter package, I hope you're excited. I know I am!
