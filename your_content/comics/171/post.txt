The Kitty Catfe is in trouble and needs our help! Located in Edmonds, WA, this local cat cafe-slash-shelter needs to find a new space before February. With moving comes sudden moving costs, and we want to help the process go smoothly! With your contributions, we can help the Catfe find a new home! Join us as we create art for kitties!

WE HAVE MET OUR FIRST GOAL OF $2500, BUT THE KITTY CATFE STILL NEEDS YOUR HELP! Kitties need food, toys, litter, medication, and other expenses to be covered! They are frequently operating on a shoestring budget and need all the help they can get! All proceeds made this week still go to them!
