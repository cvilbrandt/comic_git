And we return! Thank you so much for your patience. I know a lot of folks missed the comic while I was away but I had a lot of things to sort out between health and personal stuff. I'm feeling better and I'm ready to get back to things! Enjoy!

Look who's here! The P-Gang: Parsley, Parker, and Penny! And also a physical altercation! Oh boy oh boy.

Special thanks to patrons Chaon for Cur, Ashley Nichols for Kira, and Jonas for Jonas! Thanks for letting me use your babies!
