    <div id="about-text"><p>Tamberlane is written, drawn, and maintained by Caytlin Vilbrandt.</p>

        <p>Caytlin is a queer disabled woman from the Pacific Northwest who lives and breathes comics, art, and design.
            She writes, draws, and maintains Tamberlane for her dayjob but also illustrates and does graphic design on
            the side. Inspired heavily by the worlds of Beatrix Potter, Redwall, The Secret of Nimh, and others like
            them, she created Tamberlane as a way to pour her childhood love of talking critters into an exciting new
            adventure.</p>

        <p>Her greatest passion is telling emotionally complex stories where there is no blatant villain, for the most
            common evils in the world are more complicated than Good and Bad. She is also passionate about characters
            from marginalized backgrounds going on adventures that have nothing whatsoever to do with the trials and
            tribulations of their marginalized identity.</p>

        <p>She lives with her husband and two cats, and spends a lot of time listening to Broadway musical soundtracks
            or watching true crime docuseries on Netflix. She also dabbles in game design, web design, and tabletop
            RPGs.</p>

        <p>Caytlin lives with fibromyalgia, a disorder which means she's in varying levels of pain 100% of the time. Her
            health always comes first, and therefore sometimes the comic has to go on brief breaks while she rests and
            recovers. However, Tamberlane is her pride and joy, and she is always passionate about getting pages out as
            quickly and consistently as possible! Thank you for your enthusiasm and patience when she has to rest.</p>

        <h1>Want to Support the Comic?</h1>
        <p>Monetary support of Tamberlane goes toward our rent and bills, purchasing merchandise to sell in the shop,
            and paying my assistants to help me out with the nitty gritty of keeping this operation going. As the
            Patreon grows, I hope to hire some talented folks to help me with the actual production of the comic so that
            I can get pages out faster.</p>

        <div id="support-buttons">
            <div id="patreon-button" class="button"><a href="http://www.patreon.com/tamberlane">Become a Patron</a></div>
            <div id="coffee-button" class="button"><a href="http://www.ko-fi.com/justcaytlin">Buy the Creator a Coffee</a></div>
        </div>

            <p>However, money is far from the only way to support Tamberlane! Sharing the comic with your friends is the
            number one way to help out. Comments, words of support, fanart and other fanworks, and even just speculating
            on the story are wonderful, wonderful things that help keep me going when the creative fuel tank is low.</p>

            <p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the patience and support you've lent me over the years. You
                guys rock!</p>
