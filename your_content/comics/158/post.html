Man what is with these corgs?

<del>Hope you guys are enjoying the comic! Unfortunately, I'm taking a short break because I'm burnt out and exhausted and need some time to rest. But never fear! Tamberlane will return October 3rd! See you then, my friends!</del>

<strong>UPDATE: 10-02-18:</strong>

<strong>Hello Tamberlane Fans! Panda assistant here! Oh gosh, did we mess up with our date calculation...Caitlyn actually means to come back on Wednesday, October 10th, not Tomorrow, the 3rd.
Big huge apologies for the mixup!! ^^;
As always, we THANK YOU for your support and patience! One more week of rest for our fearless leader, and then back to the cuteness!! promise!! </strong>
