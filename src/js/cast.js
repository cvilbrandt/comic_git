            "Info":"Terra is a somewhat recent addition to Treehollow, having moved here alone in her teenage years. She was taken in at first by the Bakers, but in short time she apprenticed herself to Doctor Nora and moved in with her and Henry. She loves kids, loves to help creatures, and loves to make sad people happy; and though she’s still somewhat young in her apprenticeship, she’s shown a lot of promise.",
            "Story":
                `<p>"Mum?"</p>
                <p>Terra lifted her exhausted head, her ears twitching toward the source of tiny skunk paws in the hallway. "Yes, Marie, darling, I'm with Mummy Sylvia."</p>
                <p>The little skunk ducked inside, her paws clasped oh-so-carefully in front of her, as though she were sheltering a butterfly between her palms. "Mummy," she sniffled, "I got something that would help Mummy Sylvia."</p>
                <p>"Was it your sunny smile?" Terra asked, leaning down to help her onto the bed so she wouldn't have to relinquish her burden just yet. Sylvia groaned fitfully in her sleep, one ear twitching.</p>
                <p>"No," giggled Marie, her smile fleeting. "Parsley had magic."</p>
                <p>"Magic? Well, goodness! I'm sure that will be very helpful. May I see?"</p>
                <p>Marie nodded solemnly, and slowly she tilted her top paw off, revealing her holy relic. Inside sat a sparkling piece of quartz. Though the light in the bedroom was low, it caught what was there, scattering soft motes around the little girl's paws.</p>
                <p>"Parsley says if we believe really hard, and think of Mummy Sylvia with all our hearts, and then hold this rock really tightly..." She faltered, looking down at it. "...it's silly, isn't it?"</p>
                <p>"No," Terra was quick to say, gently brushing Marie's forelock from her eye. "It's not silly at all. I believe in magic. Do you?"</p>
                <p>Marie was quiet a moment, and then she nodded, a faint smile turning up her lips. Terra folded her paws around Marie's, so that they both cupped the stone together. "Let's think of Mummy Sylvia as hard as we can," she says, "and pour aaaaall our love into this magic stone. That way she can keep it close to her and always know we love her."</p>
                <p>"Okay."</p>
                <p>"Ready?"</p>
                <p>Marie took a deep breath, looked to her other ailing mother, and then nodded to Terra as serious as can be.</p>
                <p>"Ready."</p>`

            "Story":
                `<p>"Back straight, Winnie ol' girl," Gillian said, smacking her lower back with a heavy thump of his tail. The bat straightened like a shot, trying to stir a little faster. "Yes, sir."</p>
                <p>A wet cough sounded through the cabin, and Winnie found herself hunching again, only to be corrected once more.</p>
                <p>"It's not contagious," Gillian reminded her in an undertone. "We don't have to worry, eh?"</p>
                <p>"Yes, sir," Winnie replied softly. She couldn't help but look over at the pair huddled in the guest area. One was a bat, though not a bat like her. (Few bats were bats like her.) One of them looked so pale and sickly, she could barely stand to look at her.</p>
                <p>They were forbidden from telling anyone they made these trips. Winnie wasn't sure if it was necessarily illegal, but it wasn't something other creatures would look fondly on. Gillian had drilled that into her head from an early age. She didn't like these trips, honestly. Mortality is a hard thing to confront as a teenager.</p>
                <p>"Eyes forward," Gillian growled, and Winnie focused on the stew pot once more.</p>`
