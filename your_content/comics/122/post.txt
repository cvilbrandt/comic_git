GASP! Who let all these bats in here?!

Here are some new <a href="http://www.patreon.com/tamberlane">Patreon cameos!</a> 

The stripey gryphon is Captain Gillian, cameo of Hindae!

The two pint-sized bats in the hats are cameos of Lightfox Lowell! I know you said to pick one, but they were both so cute!

And finally, the tall purple bat is Winnie, cameo of Makuru! 

Thank you all SO MUCH for your support!
