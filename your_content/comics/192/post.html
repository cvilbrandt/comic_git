Poor Marie. Good thing she has a support network of friends!

2 trips to the ER, a second painkiller prescription, and a lot of sleepless nights later, I think the kidney stone is passed?? Hopefully? Drink your water, kids! Kidney stones suck! And now I can get back to motoring on work. I can't tell you how badly I want to get ahead of all this!

The Kickstarter has ended fabulously and I'm so thrilled! If you missed out, <a href="https://tamberlane3.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the preorder store is open.</a>

They will be delivered after the Kickstarter is fulfilled, but should still get to you before Christmas! You know, if you're already thinking about holiday gifts.
