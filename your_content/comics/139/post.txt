Whew!! This was a real thorny page! Lots and lots of things had to get drawn. As you can imagine, there are a lot of cameos!

PANEL ONE: The badger belongs to Grey White!

PANEL TWO: The raccoon belongs to Ashley Nichols and Puck belongs to Codesign!

PANEL FOUR: Gunner the bat belongs to Gunny Waffle, Asher the fox belongs to, well, Asher the Fox, and Reno the dingo belongs to DireTaco.

So glad to get more sunny faces on the page here!!!
