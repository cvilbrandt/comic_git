And we're back!! It's a good thing I went on Break, because I wound up being sick the entire month of December. But I'm better now!

I'm going to be at Further Confusion in San Jose this weekend! Come see me at the Grey White / Dreamy Star table 123. I'll have some (non-deluxe, non-Kickstarter) printed editions of Tamberlane, stickers, charms, and more cool stuff! I hope to see you guys there!
