        <h2>Tamberlane is a webcomic about a clumsy bat and her very human baby...</h2>
        <p>The animal citizens of Treehollow have discovered a small, strange creature wandering alone in the forest:
            a human child! Clearly much too young to be on her own, it’s anyone’s guess how this mysterious being, named
            Tamberlane, ended up in their town of Treehollow.</p>
        <p>Fostered by Belfry, the accident-prone bat, and guided by a colorful cast of animal characters, Tamberlane’s
            mysteries continue to unfold. But questions burn in everyone’s minds: who, and <em>what,</em> is she? And could she
            have something to do with the far-off and unspeakable taboo, Abroad?</p>
        <p><em>Tamberlane updates every Wednesday and is rated PG for occasional simplified, cartoonish nudity.</em></p>
