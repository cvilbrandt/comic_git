Tamberlane's day seems to have picked up!

I'm trying something new on this background. Usually I make the backgrounds meticulously with every surface on its own layer for maximum customizability for the scene if I need it. But that takes FOREVER. So this time I'm doing a single layer and painting it all at once, with a few parts of it on different layers so I can adjust as needed.

Let me know what you think!
