AND WE'RE BACK! Thank you so much everyone for your beautiful guest art and comics. Having this extended guest period REALLY helped me get back on my feet during a difficult time.

But we're all good now! Chapter 3 begins with the official 100th page of Tamberlane! Which is REALLY NUTS. This comic is just over a year old, so I suppose it's a rate of about 100 pages a year so far. Let's see if we can't bump that up if my health holds out, hey?

Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy chapter 3! Looks like Tamberlane's grown up a smidgeon.
